master
~~~~~~

1) [BREAKING] Drop support for TYPO3 10.4. Refactor code.
2) [BREAKING] Change folders for ``imageopt:optimizefolderimages`` task to
    ``typo3temp/assets/_processed_*jpg|gif|png,typo3temp/assets/images*jpg|gif|png``
3) [BREAKING] Add new field to ``tx_imageopt_executed`` to table ``sys_file_processedfile``.
    Now the record from ``sys_file_processedfile`` is set as to true on field
    ``tx_imageopt_executed`` even if execution was not successful. When selecting
    new filese to optimising ``tx_imageopt_executed`` is now taken into count
    and not ``tx_imageopt_executed_successfully``. This means that after
    installing this version you need to reprocess all images meaning: remove
    ``_processed_`` folder and truncate ``sys_file_processedfile`` table.
    You can also use backend module Maintenance->Remove Temporary Assets->Button Delete files in /fileadmin/_processed_/
